        You appear to be in an old kitchen. It looks like whoever 
        owned this house left in a hurry. There is an opened door in 
        front of you and the door to the entrance is to your right. 
        There is a deserted kettle on what looks to be a stove. <br> <br>
        What do you do? <br> <br>
