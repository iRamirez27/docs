        This, you could tell, was the main bedroom of the house. There
        are ruined curtains over the windows on the side of the room 
        and a destroyed mattress in the middle. To the side of the 
        mattress, there is a worn nightstand. On top of the night 
        stand, is an old, green rotary phone. <br> <br>
