            You are in a dimly lit room that seems like an entrance room 
            to a house. In the wall in front of you is a doorway with a 
            door that is slightly ajar. In the wall to your left is 
            another doorway with an open door. On the wall to your right 
            is a large painting with another closed door. <br> <br>
            What do you do? <br> <br>
