        You are in a dimly lit room that seems like an entrance room 
        to a house. In the wall in front of you is a doorway with a 
        door that is slightly ajar. In the wall to your left is 
        another doorway with an open door. On the wall to your right 
        is a large painting with another closed door. <br> <br>
        What do you do? <br> <br>
