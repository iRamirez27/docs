        As the dust settles around you, you're hit with a wave
        of nostalgia and longing for lost time. Seeing old fragments
        of memories stirs a sense of melancholy from your chest as
        you set the fork down on a nearby table. <br> <br>
        What do you do? <br> <br>

        ending 2/2
