        You look closer at the painting and see that it is a depitcion of an old, 
        abandoned refuge in what looks to be a stone ravine. There are thousands 
        of tally marks and buttons strewn across the walls. Stairs climb to the 
        top of the ravine and out of view, with walkways criss-crossing every 
        direction. You can imagine the smell of gunpowder and cigarette smoke
        filling your lungs. <br> <br>
        <img src="/docs/images/ravine.jpg"> <br> <br>
        Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a small, weathered piece of
        paper sticking out from the edge of the painting. <br> <br>
        What do you do? <br> <br>
