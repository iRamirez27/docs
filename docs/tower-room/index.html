        You entered the tower. You see sunlight just barely shining 
        through the boarded-up windows. There are papers and maps 
        scattered everywhere about the small room. There is a big 
        piece of paper on the wall in front of you with newpaper 
        articles nailed to it. There also seems to be a picture of what looks 
        like a blown-up city. <br> <br>
