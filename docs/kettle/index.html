        You look at the kettle that has been left behind. It 
        seems like it hasn't been used in years. There is 
        rust across the surface of it and there is a horrible 
        smell wafting from it. <br> <br>
        As you look closer, you see that there are words 
        etched into the side of the kettle. <br> <br>
        What do you do? <br> <br>
