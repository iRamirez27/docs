        You have now entered a large room. It seems as though it had been 
        used as a combination of a dining room and a living room. There 
        is a large dining table in the middle of the room with a single 
        fork on it. There are two open doors behind you, to your right 
        and left. There is a closed door in a slanted wall that leads to 
        a tower in front of you and to the right. There is a fourth door,
        in the corner, on the wall to your left. <br> <br>
        What do you do? <br> <br>
