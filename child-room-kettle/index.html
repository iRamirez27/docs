        You find yourself in what you think used to be a young child's
        room. There is a deteriorating baby cradle near the wall with 
        a small table and a lamp on the end. The door to the hallway 
        is behind you. There is closed door in the corner to your 
        right and directly to your right is a door that's 
        slightly ajar. <br> <br>
        What do you do? <br> <br>
